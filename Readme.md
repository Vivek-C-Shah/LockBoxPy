# LockBoxPy - A Python Obfuscator and Encryptor that uses AES, RSA and PyArmor

LockBoxPy is a software tool that encrypts a payload and creates an executable file. The tool uses RSA encryption to encrypt an AES key, which is then used to encrypt the payload using AES encryption. The resulting encrypted AES key and encrypted payload are then combined to create an executable file. The tool also obfuscates the executable file using PyArmor for added security.
